# Advanced Test Cases for Minishell

# --- Quoting and Expansion ---
echo "This is a test with 'single quotes' inside double quotes"
echo 'This is a test with "double quotes" inside single quotes'
echo "Your user is $USER and your home is $HOME"
echo 'Your user is $USER and your home is $HOME'
echo "The exit status is $?"
echo 'The exit status is $?'
echo "This will not expand: \$USER"
echo "This will expand: $USER"
export VAR="a b c"
echo $VAR
echo "$VAR"

# --- Redirections ---
echo "hello" > outfile
cat < outfile
echo "append" >> outfile
cat outfile
< infile cat > outfile2
< infile cat -e > outfile3
cat < infile | grep "line" > outfile4

# --- Pipes ---
ls -l | grep "src" | wc -l
cat Makefile | grep "FLAGS" | cut -d "=" -f 2
echo "test" | cat -e
sleep 2 | echo "finished"

# --- Built-ins and Pipes ---
export | grep "USER"
env | sort
cd /tmp | pwd

# --- Error Handling ---
cat non_existent_file
ls non_existent_dir
cd non_existent_dir
export 1VAR=invalid
export VAR=
export

# --- Complex Cases ---
echo "one" > file1
echo "two" > file2
cat < file1 | tr 'o' 'a' > file3
cat < file2 | tr 't' 'b' >> file3
cat file3
